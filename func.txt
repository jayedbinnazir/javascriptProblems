10. Set and decrease for counter
importance: 5
Modify the code of makeCounter() so that the counter can also decrease and set the number:

counter() should return the next number (as before).
counter.set(value) should set the counter to value.
counter.decrease() should decrease the counter by 1.
See the sandbox code for the complete usage example.

P.S. You can use either a closure or the function property to keep the current count. Or write both variants.

11. Sum with an arbitrary amount of brackets
importance: 2
Write function sum that would work like this:

sum(1)(2) == 3; // 1 + 2
sum(1)(2)(3) == 6; // 1 + 2 + 3
sum(5)(-1)(2) == 6
sum(6)(-1)(-2)(-3) == 0
sum(0)(1)(2)(3)(4)(5) == 15
P.S. Hint: you may need to setup custom object to primitive conversion for your function.

Open a sandbox with tests.
