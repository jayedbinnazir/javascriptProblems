1,Aymbols are skipped by for in loop / Object.keys()
2. when it comes to cloning like object.assign() it also copies symbols .
3. Array.from() works both with ArrayLike and iterable but spread syntex is 
     works with iterable --> that is converting them into a plain array

4. Call the iterator explicitly and output a string characcter by characcter
5. represent Array.from( ) with all arguments . and make an array with modified values .
6. In closure and nested function concept ,--> Imagine a function with nested one as a constructor of a new
     lexical environment . and nested function is a method for that nested object . it will make ur life
     easier
7. There are two kinds of caching logic 
  --> caching 
  --> Partial caching 
  The difference is , In caching we directly implement the caching logic for the particular function 
  bt, in partial caching we partially call the main function passing it's refrence to another function
  that provides some functionality of it's own . This is universal algorithm for all functions . bcz we can pass 
  any function to decorate it with this functionality . So, Create once unlike regular caching
  
  8. The difference between func.call()/apply()/bind() is call and apply is used while calling a function with context
     bt, bind is not for calling a function, the method bind is just for binding the context and not
     instantly calling th e 
     another main difference is that  , when we bind the function to the object , it will be availbale all over
     the code for the same object, even if we change the object nothing will interrupt with that bind function .
     iF we want to get the changed Object Method , Then we have to creat another bind function
     so the bind method is sticky
