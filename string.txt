1. How to access characters ? why we shouldn't use [] brackets for accessing
2. does strings are mutable? If not , then what to do?
3. strings are iterable? can we use for of loop?
4. change the case of the strings>
5. let str = 'As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox'; // Find the position of all occurences of 'as'
    -->There is a slight inconvenience with indexOf in the if test. We can’t put it in the if like this: explain it ,
    what is the best method searching for a substring availability?

6. let str = "stringify"; 
    use all the getSubstrings Methods and differentiate between them

7 . write about comparing order of the string
8.what is UTF-16  ?

8. Now let’s see the characters with codes 65..220 (the latin alphabet and a little bit extra) 
   by making a string of them:

9. Write a correct comparison method for striing ;
10 . '  A quick Brown Fox   '  remove the extra spaces from the start and end point of the string?
11. 'Code' repeat this string 10 times

Task-->
1.Write a function ucFirst(str) that returns the string str with the uppercased first character, for instance:
  ucFirst("john") == "John"

2.Write a function checkSpam(str) that returns true if str contains ‘viagra’ or ‘XXX’, otherwise false.
    The function must be case-insensitive:

    checkSpam('buy ViAgRA now') == true
    checkSpam('free xxxxx') == true
    checkSpam("innocent rabbit") == false

3.Create a function truncate(str, maxlength) that checks the length of the str and, if it exceeds maxlength – replaces the end of str with the ellipsis character "…", to make its length equal to maxlength.

    The result of the function should be the truncated (if needed) string.

    For instance:

    truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20) = "What I'd like to te…"

    truncate("Hi everyone!", 20) = "Hi everyone!"

4. We have a cost in the form "$120". That is: the dollar sign goes first, and then the number.

    Create a function extractCurrencyValue(str) that would extract the numeric value from such string and return it.

    The example:

    alert( extractCurrencyValue('$120') === 120 ); // true
