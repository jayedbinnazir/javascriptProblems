1. What is lexical environment ?
2. What is Variable ?
3. Make a counter function IIndependent of each other? and Explain the executing mechanism with lexical environment
4. What is closure?

5. Does a function pickup latest changes?
importance: 5
The function sayHi uses an external variable name. When the function runs, which value is it going to use?

let name = "John";

function sayHi() {
  alert("Hi, " + name);
}

name = "Pete";

sayHi(); // what will it show: "John" or "Pete"?
Such situations are common both in browser and server-side development. A function may be scheduled to execute later than it is created, for instance after a user action or a network request.

So, the question is: does it pick up the latest changes


6. Which variables are available?
importance: 5
The function makeWorker below makes another function and returns it. That new function can be called from somewhere else.

Will it have access to the outer variables from its creation place, or the invocation place, or both?

function makeWorker() {
  let name = "Pete";

  return function() {
    alert(name);
  };
}

let name = "John";

// create a function
let work = makeWorker();

// call it
work(); // what will it show?
Which value it will show? “Pete” or “John”?



7.Are counters independent?
importance: 5
Here we make two counters: counter and counter2 using the same makeCounter function.

Are they independent? What is the second counter going to show? 0,1 or 2,3 or something else?

function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function() {
    return count++;
  };
}

let counter = makeCounter();
let counter2 = makeCounter();

alert( counter() ); // 0
alert( counter() ); // 1

alert( counter2() ); // ?
alert( counter2() ); // ?


8.Counter object
importance: 5
Here a counter object is made with the help of the constructor function.

Will it work? What will it show?

function Counter() {
  let count = 0;

  this.up = function() {
    return ++count;
  };
  this.down = function() {
    return --count;
  };
}

let counter = new Counter();

alert( counter.up() ); // ?
alert( counter.up() ); // ?
alert( counter.down() ); // ?



9.Function in if
importance: 5
Look at the code. What will be the result of the call at the last line?

let phrase = "Hello";

if (true) {
  let user = "John";

  function sayHi() {
    alert(`${phrase}, ${user}`);
  }
}

sayHi();

10. Sum with closures
importance: 4
Write function sum that works like this: sum(a)(b) = a+b.

Yes, exactly this way, using double parentheses (not a mistype).

For instance:

sum(1)(2) = 3
sum(5)(-1) = 4


11.Is variable visible?
importance: 4
What will be the result of this code?

let x = 1;

function func() {
  console.log(x); // ?

  let x = 2;
}

func();
P.S. There’s a pitfall in this task. The solution is not obvious.


12. Filter through function
importance: 5
We have a built-in method arr.filter(f) for arrays. It filters all elements through the function f. If it returns true, then that element is returned in the resulting array.

Make a set of “ready to use” filters:

inBetween(a, b) – between a and b or equal to them (inclusively).
inArray([...]) – in the given array.
The usage must be like this:

arr.filter(inBetween(3,6)) – selects only values between 3 and 6.
arr.filter(inArray([1,2,3])) – selects only elements matching with one of the members of [1,2,3].
For instance:

/* .. your code for inBetween and inArray */
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

alert( arr.filter(inBetween(3, 6)) ); // 3,4,5,6

alert( arr.filter(inArray([1, 2, 10])) ); // 1,2
Open a sandbox with tests.

13. Sort by field
importance: 5
We’ve got an array of objects to sort:

let users = [
  { name: "John", age: 20, surname: "Johnson" },
  { name: "Pete", age: 18, surname: "Peterson" },
  { name: "Ann", age: 19, surname: "Hathaway" }
];
The usual way to do that would be:

// by name (Ann, John, Pete)
users.sort((a, b) => a.name > b.name ? 1 : -1);

// by age (Pete, Ann, John)
users.sort((a, b) => a.age > b.age ? 1 : -1);
Can we make it even less verbose, like this?

users.sort(byField('name'));
users.sort(byField('age'));
So, instead of writing a function, just put byField(fieldName).

Write the function byField that can be used for that.


14.Army of functions
importance: 5
The following code creates an array of shooters.

Every function is meant to output its number. But something is wrong…

function makeArmy() {
  let shooters = [];

  let i = 0;
  while (i < 10) {
    let shooter = function() { // create a shooter function,
      alert( i ); // that should show its number
    };
    shooters.push(shooter); // and add it to the array
    i++;
  }

  // ...and return the array of shooters
  return shooters;
}

let army = makeArmy();

// all shooters show 10 instead of their numbers 0, 1, 2, 3...
army[0](); // 10 from the shooter number 0
army[1](); // 10 from the shooter number 1
army[2](); // 10 ...and so on.
Why do all of the shooters show the same value?

Fix the code so that they work as intended.
