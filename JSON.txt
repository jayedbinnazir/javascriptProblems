1. Why We use JSON ---> 2 reason ?
2. What Type of properties are skipped by The JOSN methods and why ?
3. Circular References lead to error .. How to solve it? Give an example?
4. Implement toJSON methods
5. Deserialize the The circular Object That we have made JSON format and date Object should be present There


6. Turn the user into JSON and then read it back into another variable.

let user = {
  name: "John Smith",
  age: 35
};


7. Exclude backreferences
importance: 5
In simple cases of circular references, we can exclude an offending property from serialization by its name.

But sometimes we canâ€™t just use the name, as it may be used both in circular references and normal properties. So we can check the property by its value.

Write replacer function to stringify everything, but remove properties that reference meetup:

let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  occupiedBy: [{name: "John"}, {name: "Alice"}],
  place: room
};

// circular references
room.occupiedBy = meetup;
meetup.self = meetup;

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup, function replacer(key, value) {
  /* your code */
}));

/* result should be:
{
  "title":"Conference",
  "occupiedBy":[{"name":"John"},{"name":"Alice"}],
  "place":{"number":23}
}
*/
