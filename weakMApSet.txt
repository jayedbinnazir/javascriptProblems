1. Why we use weakmap over map and weakset over set ?
2. Why the doesn't support iteration ?
3. where do we need such a data structure? Sow an example
4. Implement Caching Logic with it
5. Why weakset is used for , membership in weakset meanS?


6. Store "unread" flags
importance: 5
There’s an array of messages:

let messages = [
  {text: "Hello", from: "John"},
  {text: "How goes?", from: "John"},
  {text: "See you soon", from: "Alice"}
];
Your code can access it, but the messages are managed by someone else’s code. New messages are added, 
old ones are removed regularly by that code, and you don’t know the exact moments when it happens.

Now, which data structure could you use to store information about whether the message “has been read”?
 The structure must be well-suited to give the answer “was it read?” for the given message object.

P.S. When a message is removed from messages, it should disappear from your structure as well.

P.P.S. We shouldn’t modify message objects, add our properties to them. As they are managed by someone else’s code,
 that may lead to bad consequences.

7. Store read dates
importance: 5
There’s an array of messages as in the previous task. The situation is similar.

let messages = [
  {text: "Hello", from: "John"},
  {text: "How goes?", from: "John"},
  {text: "See you soon", from: "Alice"}
];
The question now is: which data structure you’d suggest to store the information: “when the message was read?”.

In the previous task we only needed to store the “yes/no” fact. Now we need to store the date, and it should only remain in memory until the message is garbage collected.

P.S. Dates can be stored as objects of built-in Date class, that we’ll cover later.
