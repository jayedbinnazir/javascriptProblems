1. Write down the setTimeout() and setInterval()  syntexes with example ?
2. what is the significance of alert,prompt, confirm modal in timer function ?
3. How to replace setInterval ? why to replace? 2 Reasons ? 
4. Why nested timeout is so flexible against setInterval . Give an example?

5. let result = false ;

let timer = setTimeout(function change(){
   
   console.log('tick') ;

   setTimeout(()=>{result = true , console.log('5second call is executed')},5000)

   if(result){
      timer = setTimeout(change ,2000)
   }


},2000)
 Findout the flaw of this code and correct it

 6. let sum = 0 ;
function logTick(){
   for(let i = 0 ; i<=100000000 ; i++ ){
      sum+=i
   }
   console.log(sum , 'times')
   return sum
}

console.log(sum)

 
let timer = setInterval(function tick(){

   logTick()
   
},1000)

what is happening and why ?


7. Whay we should clear the time?

8. What is Zero delay setTimeout?

9. Write a function printNumbers(from, to) that outputs a number every second, starting from from and ending with to.

Make two variants of the solution.

Using setInterval.
Using nested setTimeout.

10. What will setTimeout show?
importance: 5
In the code below thereâ€™s a setTimeout call scheduled, then a heavy calculation is run, that takes more than 100ms to finish.

When will the scheduled function run?

After the loop.
Before the loop.
In the beginning of the loop.
What is alert going to show?

let i = 0;

setTimeout(() => alert(i), 100); // ?

// assume that the time to execute this function is >100ms
for(let j = 0; j < 100000000; j++) {
  i++;
}
