1. What is the benifit using map over plain object
2. Convert Object->Map / Map->Object
3. What is set? And what is it's feature? Give an Example?
4. The alternative to Set could be an array of users,
   and the code to check for duplicates on every insertion using arr.find. 
5. What is built for compatibility witha map ? How can we replace map by set with ease and vice-versa ? give an Example
    Make a shopping Cart for giving this example .
6.When we need Set Over map ? Give an example by tracking IP addresses


7.Filter unique array members
importance: 5
Let arr be an array.

Create a function unique(arr) that should return an array with unique items of arr.

For instance:

function unique(arr) {
  /* your code */
}

let values = ["Hare", "Krishna", "Hare", "Krishna",
  "Krishna", "Krishna", "Hare", "Hare", ":-O"
];

alert( unique(values) ); // Hare, Krishna, :-O
P.S. Here strings are used, but can be values of any type.

P.P.S. Use Set to store unique values.

8.Filter anagrams
importance: 4
Anagrams are words that have the same number of same letters, but in different order.

For instance:

nap - pan
ear - are - era
cheaters - hectares - teachers
Write a function aclean(arr) that returns an array cleaned from anagrams.

For instance:

let arr = ["nap", "teachers", "cheaters", "PAN", "ear", "era", "hectares"];

alert( aclean(arr) ); // "nap,teachers,ear" or "PAN,cheaters,era"
From every anagram group should remain only one word, no matter which one.

9.Iterable keys
importance: 5
We’d like to get an array of map.keys() in a variable and then apply array-specific methods to it, e.g. .push.

But that doesn’t work:

let map = new Map();

map.set("name", "John");

let keys = map.keys();

// Error: keys.push is not a function
keys.push("more");
Why? How can we fix the code to make keys.push work?
